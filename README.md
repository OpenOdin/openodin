# OpenOdin

OpenOdin is a database built for modern interoperable applications.

- [Quick Start](#quick-start)

## What is OpenOdin?

OpenOdin is a permissioned graph database layered on top of PostgreSQL and SQLite.

A graph data structure allows for many types of different applicatons and use cases since content most often has some parent relationship to other content. 

For example chat messages (child nodes) inside a chat room (the parent node) is a typical graph data structure.

Two benefits of using a graph data structure:

1. Whole and/or parts of applications and data can have clear definitions and become easily interoperable
2. Allow for efficient data licensing by adding license nodes alongside data nodes where permissions are automatically enforced by the database to lift that heavy work from applications and backends.

OpenOdin is written in TypeScript to work seamlessly both on server-side and in browsers.

## Why use OpenOdin?

By building your applications on an interoperable base layer you signal a modern approach of user respecting mentality.

Simultanously you can automatically adhere to regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA and the Digital Markets Act by allowing users to own their interoperable data for them to regulate and move asthey wish.

Overall by stepping into this new era of data interoperability we will see ecosystems of data enrichment grow where every application can serve as a building block for another application.

Be modern, respect your users and do not get headaches over data regulations as users are already in ownership and control over their data.
